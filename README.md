<h1> A Little Bit About Myself</h1>
<p>I am currently learning <b>Web Development</b> online at Udemy and taking the <i>Web Development Bootcamp</i></p>
<h2>What have I currently learned:</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>The Introduction to Html and Intermediate Html</li>
  <li>The different Resource Sites used for when one is stuck and needs help or guidence</li>
  <li>How to use different websites and programs for Web Development:
    <ol>Visual Code Studio</ol>
    <ol>GitHub</ol>
    <ol>WordPress<ol></ul>
</ul>
<p><i>For a side note, Udemy is helping me learn how to use Visual Code, Github is helping me learn GitHub, and WordPress is a site you can create a webpage at and use HTML and CSS coding in, and I'm self teaching myself how to use that site.</i></p>
    </br>
    <h2>Aside From Learning Web Development</h2>
    <p>I Enjoy spending time with family, work in a Hotel and want to do something else with my life, I have two crazy Kitty Cats Mufasa and Sarabi, who are cute but like to beat me up sometimes, I enjoy playing DayZ on Xbox with my Dad and Husband, and I like Camping and hiking. Sleeping in a Hammock is the best! Debate me.</p>
